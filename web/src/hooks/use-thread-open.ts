 * Opening used to happen twice for one click: the sidebar row resumed the

 * turn errors, so a single click cost eight requests and transferred the turn
 * payload twice. Worse, resume takes writer ownership of a paginated thread, so
 * the duplicate was two attempts to claim the same thing.
 *
 * There is exactly one owner now: the route. Every other surface navigates.
